# Current state — TheraBridge-Emergent

## Current addendum — TB-EM-015, 2026-10-21

The original bootstrap record below is historical. The application exists on main through PR #57 (`f49ade4125cdb26e11fd7eb2cc80c292a48f00a9`). Session execution and synthetic dictation are implemented on isolated `freebuff/tb-em-015-session-workflow`; no merge or deployment authorized/performed. API: 453/453 real PostgreSQL tests, typecheck/build PASS. Web typecheck/build, responsive DOM and real browser/API/PostgreSQL synthetic journey PASS. Docker smoke BLOCKED (socket permissions). Real recording/STT, AI, signing/release, consent and pilot use remain disabled. GitHub draft PR/CI and Mistral review require authenticated delivery; see `artifacts/tb-em-015/VALIDATION.md` and `docs/emergent/workunits/TB-EM-015.md` for actual evidence and unresolved boundaries.

## Historical bootstrap record

**As of:** 2026-10-20 (UAE)
**Stage:** PRE-BUILD / documentation bootstrap
**Latest verified content:** Repo initialized with README, AGENTS and starter handover instructions. **No Emergent code has been imported/exported yet.**
**Functional app:** NONE
**Tests executed:** 0
**Database:** NONE
**Production/clinical pilot:** NO-GO
**Synthetic records only:** required for future work.

## Initial work unit

`TB-EM-001` — Emergent feasibility review, GitHub export mechanics, portable stack assessment and Phase 1 plan.

### Required before implementation
- Upload owner-provided master blueprint v2 and continuity protocol to Emergent in the first planning job.
- Review Emergent architecture for support of selected Next.js + NestJS/Fastify + PostgreSQL/Prisma stack.
- Decide whether the build is an approved-stack implementation or *explicitly labeled synthetic prototype*.
- Document how Emergent will export to this **existing** repository branch without overwriting `main`; verify first checkpoint.
- Confirm no real patient/child records, external publishing or unauthorized clinical workflows.

### Remaining
- No source code, data schema, migrations, seeds, API, CI or tests exist.
- No independently reproducible app exists; **TAKEOVER NOT YET VERIFIED**.
- Owner must approve the plan before the first code build.

Once the first verified GitHub export exists, replace these statements with actual branch/SHA, test commands, PASS/FAIL/NOT RUN, source paths, working links and blockers.
